# IFBID Model

The Paper **"IFBiD: Inference-Free Bias Detection"** submitted at the AAAI Workshop on Artificial Intelligence Safety (SafeAI) presents a deep learning architecture for the detection of bias in classifier networks.

It 

The proposed architecture is a convolutional neural network that uses layer weights (not layer biases)...

# This Directory

Here, we implement the IFBID architecture with the libraries Pytorch and Pytorch-Lightning. Importantly, **as of now we have only implemented the IFBID architecture for the DigitWB** database.
